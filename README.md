You need to go to the .idea folder. There you will find two main files. First one is index.html and the second one is style.css
You need just two this files to run the code. Enter an index.html file and run it locally in your browser or use it for creating your own design. Feel free to 
use it however you want. You can just use this pars of the css code in the cstyle.css to style your webpage and make it look brilliant. Add some art touch
